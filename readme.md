#keyboard-navigate

Lightweight plugin to apply keyboard supported navigation through commonly used hotkeys.

## Demo

`<ul>
	<li>Current page</li>
	<li><a href="page2.html">Page 2</a></li>
</ul>`

could be translated with `$('ul').keyboardNavigate()`.

This would let <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> go to page2.
